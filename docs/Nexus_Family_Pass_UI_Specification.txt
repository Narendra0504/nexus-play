# NEXUS FAMILY PASS - COMPLETE UI SPECIFICATION FOR ANGULAR

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a complete Angular 17+ application for "Nexus Family Pass" - a B2B2C platform where companies provide activity subscriptions for employees' children. The app has 4 user roles: Parent, HR Admin, Venue Admin, and Platform Admin.

Use Angular standalone components, Angular Material UI library, TailwindCSS for styling, and follow a clean modern design with a primary color palette of blue (#2c5282) and teal (#319795) accents. The app should be fully responsive (mobile-first).
